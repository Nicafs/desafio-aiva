# AIVA Challenge ‚Äî React Admin Panel

Welcome to the AIVA Challenge!  
This project is a modern, fully-typed React + TypeScript admin panel, designed for technical evaluation and real-world scalability. It demonstrates best practices in architecture, componentization, state management, API integration, and automated testing.

---

## üöÄ **Tech Stack**

- **React 18** (with functional components & hooks)
- **TypeScript** (strict typing everywhere)
- **Vite** (fast dev/build tool)
- **Material UI (MUI)** (UI components & theming)
- **React Query** (data fetching, caching, mutations)
- **Zustand** (global state management for auth)
- **Zod** (schema validation for forms)
- **React Hook Form** (form state & validation)
- **Jest + React Testing Library** (unit tests)
- **Axios** (HTTP client)
- **ESLint & Prettier** (code quality & formatting)
